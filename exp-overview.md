## Experiment procedure 

### Day 1

---

#### 1) Pattern seperation

- from Stark lab, matlab version with modification
- used material Set C, set group variable to 1 (fix the target, lure and foil list)
- Learning: 

  - 64 colorful object pictures. The items order was randomized across subjects.

  - During each trial, a fixation was presented for 0.5s followed by a picture for 2s. Subjects was instructed to indicate whether the item was an indoor or outdoor item before the item disappered.

  - The learning phase lasts for about 3 mins.  
- Testing: 
  - 196 colorful object pictures (64 target, 64 lure and 64 foil). The items order was randomized across subjects.
  - During each trial, a fixation was presented for 0.5s followed by a picture for 4s.  Subjects was instructed to indicate whether the item was old (studied in learning phase), similar (same object but not indentical to the studied item) or new (never studied) before the item disappered.
  - The testing phase lasts for about 15 mins.

#### 2) Associative memory

- Learning: 

  - 48 colorful  word-scene association. The association and order are randomized  across subjects. 


- During each trial, a word-face association were presented for 3s, followed by a ISI for 1s. Subjects were instructed to indicate the strength of relations between the word and scene.


- The learning phase lasts for about 3.5 mins. 

- Testing:

  - 96 colorful  word-scene association (48 pairs were indentical to studied pairs, old; 48 pairs were not studied before, new). 
  - During each trial, a fixation was presented for 0.5s followed by a word-scene pair. Subjects were instructed to indicate whether the pair was studied in the learning phase from 1-certainly-new to 6-certainly old. Only if both the face and name were studied in learning phase and its association were correct, the pair should be consider as old. The word-scene pair was presented for 8s or until subjects made response. 
  - The testing phase last for about 3mins.


#### 3) Verbal memory 

- WASI-IV memory section
- Free recall task
- 96 word in total, composed of 12 lists 
- Learning: 
  - Subjects were instructed to passive view and memorize each word presented on screen. The  word were divided to 12 lists and words within list shared a common theme. Each word were presented for 2s with 0.5s ISI. Before each list, there was an instruction to inform subjects that upcoming word were from same list.
  - The learning phase lasts for about 5 mins.
- Testing:
  - Subjects were given 10 mins to write down the words that they studied before. They were instructed to recall as many as possible words and follow the order words came to their mind instead of the learning order.
  - The testing phase lasts for 10 mins.

#### 4) Spatial working memory

- TBA, maybe symmetry span

### Day 2

---

#### 1) Pre-test

- (same procedure as post-test in scanner)

#### 2) Mnemonic course

- watch training video and go through the training materials

### Day 3

---

- Mnemonic practice 1 (1 list with 30 items)

### Day 4

---

- Mnemonic practice 2 (2 list with 60 items)

### Day 5

---

- Mnemonic practice 3 (2 list with 60 items)

### Day 6

---

#### 1) In scanner tasks

- Preparation: 5 mins

- Field map: 2 mins

- MTL high-resolution resting: 8 mins

- Functional localizer: 7 mins.

  - The functional localizer including 2 types task, passive view and imagination. Each task had 1 run. During task, subjects were instructed to passive view or imagine the loci picture in order to obtain the neural representation of each loci.
  - During each trial, a fixation was presented for 0.5s followed by a loci's picture for 4s in passive view task or a number indicate the loci to be imagined for 1s and 3s fixation. Then an self-paced orientation task servered as an active baseline was conducted for 5.5s. In passive view task, subjects were instructed to view the picture of loci carefully. Instead, subjects need to use the number cue to imaginate the corresponding loci as detail as possible. No responses were required in both task in this time.
  - In both task, each loci were presented for twice in two mini-block. In each block, all 10 loci  were presented once and the order was randomised. Besides, the minimal lag between repetition was greater than 3 across blocks. The order of the two task was counterbalanced across subjects.
  - Each task lasts for about 3.5 mins.

- Encoding-retrieval cycles (19 mins per cycle, 1 hr in total)

  - There were 3 encoding-retrieval cycles in this phase. Each cycle begun with an encoding run that subjects were instructed to learning 30 concrete nouns use the trained mnemonic. After an 5 mins distraction task (see below). Subjects were instructed to indicate the exact temporal location during previous encoding phase for each word. 

  - Encoding: (7 mins)

    During each trial, subjects were presented with a fixation for 0.5s, followed by a noun for 2s. After the noun, a fixation was presented for 4s. So the subjects could take advantage of the mnemonic to achieve better memory. Then an self-paced orientation task servered as an active baseline was conducted for 7.5s. The order of the nouns were randomized for each subjects. Each encoding phase lasts for 7 mins.

  - Distraction task (spatial working memory): 4.5 mins

    The distraction task evaluated subjects' spatial working memory ability. There were 36 trials in total during the task with 3 memory load condition (2,4,6). During each trial, a 4*4 grid was presented and 2, 4 or 6 dots were presented in random locations in the grid for 2s. Subjects were instructed to memorize the locations for all the dots. Then a fixation was presented and subjects need to maintain the dots locations for subsequent test. After 4s, a dot was presented in the grid for 2s followed by an ISI for about 1s (from an exponential distribution, range: 0.5-4s, mean = 1s) and subjects need to indicate whether the dot's location was matched to any of the encoding dots. The 3 load conditions were intermixed within in run and half of the trials was mismatched. For the mismatched trials, the dot's location was always adjacent to a correct location.

  - Retrieval: (7 mins)

    During each trial, subjects were presented with a fixation for 0.5s, followed by a noun for 2s. Subjects were instructed to recall the nouns encoding detail as vivid as possible during that time. Then a slide bar was present within a random initial position. Subjects needs to press button to move the slider left or right to indicate the exact temporal location of the noun during the encoding phase (e.g.. The word 'tiger' was the13th word learned in the encoding phase. When subjects were presented this word, they should adjust the slider to about 13/30 from the left end of the slider bar.). There was 4s for subjects to adjust the slider and they used a third key to confirm the position when they satisfied. Then an self-paced orientation task servered as an active baseline was conducted for 7.5s. The order of the nouns were randomized for each subjects.

  - Distraction task (spatial working memory): 4.5 mins

    The distraction task evaluated subjects' spatial working memory ability. There were 36 trials in total during the task with 3 memory load condition (2,4,6). During each trial, a 4*4 grid was presented and 2, 4 or 6 dots were presented in random locations in the grid for 2s. Subjects were instructed to memorize the locations for all the dots. Then a fixation was presented and subjects need to maintain the dots locations for subsequent test. After 4s, a dot was presented in the grid for 2s followed by an ISI for about 1s (from an exponential distribution, range: 0.5-4s, mean = 1s) and subjects need to indicate whether the dot's location was matched to any of the encoding dots. The 3 load conditions were intermixed within in run and half of the trials was mismatched. For the mismatched trials, the dot's location was always adjacent to a correct location.
